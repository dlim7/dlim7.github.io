I have been interested in software engineering starting from when I was in my senior year of Highschool and took my first programming class "AP Computer Science". I felt a great sense of accomplishment from finishing a program especially if that program had been giving me headaches trying to iron out all the bugs. That sense of accomplishment was the not only very satisfying in a sense that I was accomplishing something but it was also very fun considering it was for school. 

I hope to in the future delve deeper into web development and create my own website and to posibly develop a phone application/game. Hopefully I will also make lots of long lasting connections with others I work with to create something that will fill us all with the same sense of accomplishment I felt from creating my first hello world program.
