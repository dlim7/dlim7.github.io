Overall I found Javascript to be a fun language to learn that has a lot of capability that Java doesn't such as not having to declare variable types that I really like. Having to use const or let to specify the scope is a tad annoying though coming from java where I wouldn't have to worry about that. If I had to rank javascript it would be my second favorite language behind python which I prefer for its readability.
