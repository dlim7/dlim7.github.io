Coding standards were a struggle for me to work with as I find being organized a constant struggle. This is even more true in coding where I have to keep track of so many things at once that I don't often spare much thought to how im implementing code. As the semester progressed I became more used to the standards that this class required and so less effort was taken to go back and fix spacing or indention as much as before which I think helped with the readability. There are a couple of things that I would have prefered to have done differently as a matter of preference and I believe that I will go back to doing after this class is over.
