JumpRunMan was a platformer game that my team and I developed for our final prject in our ICS 111 course. I thought of the project idea when I noticed there was a sirt of "collision" detection built in to the library our professor gave us and thought we could develop a game out of it. 

The "man" would have to make it up a series of platforms he could collide with and would fall if not currently colliding with a platform. To add a layer of difficulty we also implemented a lava block that would creep up the page and in the even that the "man" collided with it the game would end.
