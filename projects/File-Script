A short script made to traverse a file system and search for a file that was updated after a date the user inputs. The script would also take a particular directory you would like to conduct the search. I used a simple regex to find a files updated time. The implemnentation was a bit difficult to get working on both Mac and Windows, which is what I spent most of my time on.
