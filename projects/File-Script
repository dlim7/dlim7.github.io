ManoaMaps was a web based application intended to help UH Manoa students find where they were allowed to park. UH Manoa is infamous for having a inconvenient parkiung situation and so this app allowed users to find where their parking pass allowed them to park on a map. This map started as simple image overlays but eventually a google maps implementation was done
